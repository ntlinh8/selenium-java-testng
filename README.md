## Introduction

Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web browser interactions, while TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language. This repository combines the capabilities of Selenium WebDriver with the flexibility and ease of use of TestNG to create a robust testing framework for web applications.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, which enhances test maintainability and readability by separating web page elements and their interactions into reusable classes.
- **TestNG Annotations**: Utilizes TestNG annotations to manage test execution flow, setup, and teardown activities.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Supports data-driven testing by integrating external data sources such as Excel spreadsheets or CSV files to parameterize test cases.
- **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive test execution reports using TestNG's built-in reporting features or custom reporting libraries.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Enables testing across multiple browsers by leveraging Selenium WebDriver's support for various web browsers.
- **Parallel Execution**: Allows for parallel execution of test cases, maximizing testing efficiency and reducing execution time.

## Setup

To set up the Selenium Java TestNG Framework locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ntlinh8/selenium-java-testng.git
```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies, including Java Development Kit (JDK), Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and any additional libraries or tools required for your specific testing needs.

3. **Configuration**: Configure any necessary settings or parameters in the framework, such as browser configurations, test data sources, or reporting options.

## Writing Tests

Once the framework is set up, you can start writing automated tests using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- **Page Objects**: Create separate page classes for each web page under test, encapsulating the page elements and their interactions.
- **Test Cases**: Write test cases using TestNG annotations such as `@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`, and `@AfterMethod` to define test methods, setup, and teardown activities.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: If applicable, parameterize test cases using TestNG's `@DataProvider` or by reading data from external sources.

## Running Tests

To execute the automated tests using the Selenium Java TestNG Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Compile**: Compile the Java code to ensure that all necessary files are compiled correctly.

2. **Run Tests**: Use your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to execute the test suites defined in the framework. Alternatively, you can run individual test classes or methods directly from your integrated development environment (IDE).

3. **Review Reports**: After the tests have completed execution, review the test execution reports generated by TestNG or any custom reporting libraries integrated into the framework.
